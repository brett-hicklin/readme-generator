# readme generator

## Description

Using node.js and the inquirer package, the user will answer several questions, and based on their responses will generate a README.md file. This file will contain the title, description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage instructions, contribution instructions, license badge and link (if selected from list provided), user Github repo, and users email address.

## Installation
To install this app, the user must type the command 

```
npm i
```

## Usage
To use this app, the user must run the index.js file, by typing the command 

```
node index.js
```

The user will then be prompted with several questions, one at a time. Using either the enter button to submit the text response, or by using the arrow keys to select from multiple choice options, one the last question is answered, a message "You've successfully created a README file!" will be displayed in the terminal and a README.md file will be created. You can keep running the the app and re-entering information, and it will update the README that has already been created, it WILL NOT create a new README.md each time it is ran.

a sample readme.md is provided in this repo, as well as a link to watch a video [walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5JZPckxjfUeG6ablq8x2wx8T1rW-AMO/view).
